## Executive Summary
I build systems that solve real problems — end-to-end. With a strong foundation in backend engineering, cloud-native infrastructure, and applied AI, I lead the design, delivery, and operation of production-grade web platforms and data-driven products. My work spans agritech advisory systems, enterprise MIS, internal operations tools, and high-impact organizational websites. I blend technical depth (Kubernetes, Docker, Django, React) with product thinking and a marketer’s eye for user adoption.

I am **KCNA-certified** (Kubernetes Cloud Native Associate, Sept 27, 2025), **AWS Cloud Practitioner** (May 2, 2023), and hold multiple **ALX credentials** in software engineering and AI. I specialise in building resilient, observable, and secure systems that perform under constraints — from edge/low-bandwidth farmer interfaces to enterprise admin dashboards.

## Core Strengths & Value Proposition
- **Systems to outcomes:** I translate business or mission goals into technical roadmaps, shipping features that measurably improve operations and user experiences.
- **Cloud-native production:** Architecting deployable, maintainable services with CI/CD, observability, and secure practices.
- **AI in practice:** Integrating AI where it creates measurable value — automated testing, context-aware recommendations, and developer-assist workflows.
- **Full-stack leadership:** Hands-on coding across frontend, backend, infra, plus product design, marketing collateral, and ongoing ops.
- **Domain fluency (Agritech & Marketing):** Building domain-aware features such as altitude-aware seed recommendations and practical farmer-facing guidance.
